Also to help me understand how to manage packages with easy_install and pip for Python.\r\n\r\n###How was it done?\r\n\r\nThis DMCshot.py was created in VIM on my own laptop. I decided to use VIM because I enjoy learning new things and VIM really has increased my productivity by learning the shortcuts and having amazing plug ins.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
